# System Design

## Purpose

Walk Forward Auto Optimizer belongs to the agentic quant research milestone layer. Its purpose is to construct train/test windows and choose parameter settings from frozen validation scores. The public
implementation is intentionally small, but the surrounding design notes explain the production
boundary a reviewer should expect from a serious trading-systems prototype.

## Component Boundary

The model accepts synthetic, deterministic inputs and emits a compact score, verdict, parsed state,
or selected candidate. That boundary is useful because it can be replayed, tested in CI, and later
compared against optimized implementations without changing expected behavior.

## Data Flow

Inputs are normalized first, then passed through a pure model function, then converted into a
human-readable result. Logging, dashboards, live connectivity, and trade execution are intentionally
outside this repository. This separation prevents a research utility from being confused with a
production system while still showing how the component could fit into a larger stack.

## Extension Path

The next deeper version should add richer fixtures, a JSON report format, and an experiment manifest.
Those additions would let the portfolio dashboard compare runs across symbols, sessions, data
versions, and parameter sets while keeping the core model easy to review.
